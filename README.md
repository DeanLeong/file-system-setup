## Terminal Exercise

### Enable Visual Studio Code to be accessed from the terminal by following these steps:
  - Open Visual Studio Code: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> (Command + spacebar)
  - "Visual Studio Code"
  - Enter
  - Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.
  - Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

1. Open the Terminal:
  - <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> (Command + spacebar)
  - "Terminal"
  - Enter


1. Now create a `general_assembly` directory in your home directory (`mkdir general_assembly`)

1. Change into the `general_assembly` directory and create a directory for `sei`. 

1. Create a directory named after your cohort and `cd` into the directory.

1. Now make a directory for each unit i.e. `unit_1`, `unit_2`, `unit_3`, `unit_4`.

1. Change into each `unit_#` directory, and create a directory for each week i.e. `week_1`, `week_2`, ..., `week_12`.

1. Inside of `week_1`, create a new directory for each day i.e. `monday`, `tuesday`, ... `friday`.

1. Inside each day, create directories for the different sections each day i.e. `morning_exercise`, `morning_lecture`, `morning_lab`, `afternoon_lecture`, `afternoon_lab`, `homework`. Remember that Wednesday is a half day. 

### Now we have created a nice organized file structure for success in SEI
